# Temp Directory Organization

Structured temporary files for Claude Code CLI strategic work.

## Directory Structure

```
temp/
├── README.md                              # This file
├── prompts/                               # Claude Code CLI prompts
│   └── strategic-planning-prompt.md       # Strategic planning session prompt
└── notes/                                 # Analysis and planning notes  
    └── system-thinking-analysis-notes.md  # System thinking methodology notes
```

## File Conventions

- **Metadata headers**: All files include YAML frontmatter with creation date, purpose, status, and language
- **Descriptive naming**: Clear, kebab-case filenames that describe content
- **Original tracking**: Reference to original filename when migrated
- **Structured content**: Proper markdown formatting with sections

## Usage

- **prompts/**: Ready-to-use Claude Code CLI commands and prompts
- **notes/**: Draft analysis, planning notes, and methodology content

Files here are temporary/draft content that may be promoted to permanent locations or archived in session documentation.
