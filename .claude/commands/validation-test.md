# Validation Test Command

This is a minimal proof-of-concept slash command to validate that custom commands work in our environment.

## Test Actions

1. **Echo Test**: Verify basic bash execution
2. **Environment Check**: Display current working directory
3. **Success Confirmation**: Confirm command execution works

## Implementation

!echo "‚úÖ Slash command proof-of-concept working!"
!echo "üìÅ Current directory: $(pwd)"
!echo "üéØ Custom command execution: SUCCESS"

**Result**: If you see the above three messages, the slash command system is functional and ready for Phase 1A implementation.
