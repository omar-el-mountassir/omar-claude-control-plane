**Module**: System Self-Reflection & Architectural Intelligence  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-10  
**Scope**: Information about the system itself, architectural decisions, and evolution tracking

## Meta vs Other Modules Distinction

### Meta (This Module)
- **Purpose**: System self-reflection and architectural intelligence
- **Source**: Analysis, decisions, and documentation about the system itself
- **Nature**: Self-referential, architectural, evolutionary
- **Examples**: Architecture analysis, decision records, system evolution documentation

### Other Modules Handle Content
- **config/** = Rules and standards (how to behave)
- **operations/** = Behavioral patterns (what to do)
- **memory/** = Experiential learning (what was learned)
- **knowledge/** = Curated reference materials (what to reference)

## Meta Organization Structure

### Architecture Analysis
- **Purpose**: Deep architectural evaluation and decision documentation
- **Content**: System analysis reports, architectural assessments, design evaluations
- **Location**: `meta/architecture/`
- **Examples**: CLAUDE.md analysis, global architecture evaluation, category assessments

### Evolution Tracking  
- **Purpose**: Document how the system changes and grows over time
- **Content**: Version history, migration records, change documentation
- **Location**: `meta/evolution/`
- **Examples**: Architecture migrations, category additions, structural changes

### System Documentation
- **Purpose**: Self-documentation and how-to guides for the system
- **Content**: Usage guides, architectural principles, maintenance procedures
- **Location**: `meta/documentation/`
- **Examples**: Architecture principles, maintenance guides, usage patterns

## Meta Management Protocols

### Adding Architectural Analysis
1. **Complete Analysis**: Ensure analysis is thorough and well-documented
2. **Permanent Storage**: Place in appropriate meta subdirectory (not temp/)
3. **Decision Recording**: Document rationale and decision process
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related modules and configurations
5. **Version Tracking**: Include dates and version information

### System Evolution Documentation
- **Change Records**: Document all significant architectural changes
- **Migration Tracking**: Record how and why structures evolved
- **Decision Rationale**: Preserve reasoning behind architectural choices
- **Impact Assessment**: Document effects of changes on system behavior
- **Changelog Integration**: Major changes documented in root CHANGELOG.md for chronological tracking

---

## Meta Access Patterns

### For AI Agents
- **Architectural Queries**: "What does the meta analysis say about [architecture topic]?"
- **Decision Lookup**: Find rationale behind architectural choices
- **Evolution Understanding**: Understand how system has changed over time
- **Self-Documentation**: Access guides for system usage and maintenance

### Integration with Other Modules
- **Config Validation**: Meta analysis informs configuration decisions
- **Operations Enhancement**: Architectural insights improve operational patterns
- **Memory Contextualization**: System evolution provides context for experiential learning
- **Knowledge Integration**: Architectural intelligence becomes curated knowledge
