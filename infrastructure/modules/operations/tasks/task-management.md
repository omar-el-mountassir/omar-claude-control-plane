# Task Management - Omar El Mountassir

**Module**: Dual-Mode Task Processing & Strategic Execution  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-11  
**Scope**: Smart task categorization and optimal execution timing

## Dual-Mode Decision Framework

**Choose execution mode based on task characteristics:**

### Immediate TodoWrite (Current Conversation)

**Use when task is**:
- **Blocking**: Can't proceed without completion
- **Quick**: Single step, < 5 minutes effort
- **Context-Dependent**: Needs current conversation state
- **Critical**: Urgent fix or correction needed

**Examples**: Bug fixes, simple file edits, immediate clarifications, critical corrections

### Strategic Logging (Batch Processing)

**Use when task is**:
- **Complex**: Multi-step, requires planning
- **Non-Blocking**: Other work can continue
- **Research/Analysis**: Investigation or study needed
- **Organization**: Cleanup, restructuring, optimization

**Examples**: System improvements, research projects, documentation updates, architectural changes

## Task Logging Process

**Location**: `global/logs/tasks/task-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Capture Format**:
```
### [HH:MM] - [Category]
**Description**: What needs to be done
**Context**: Why this came up
**Priority**: Low/Medium/High  
**Effort**: Quick/Medium/Complex
**Dependencies**: Prerequisites needed
**Best Context**: When/how to optimally execute
**Status**: Logged/Planned/In-Progress/Completed
```

## Batch Processing Windows

### Morning Planning (Start of Work)
- Review previous day's incomplete tasks
- Prioritize today's logged tasks  
- Plan execution sequence and timing
- Identify dependency chains

### Session Break Reviews (Natural Pauses)
- Quick triage of accumulated logged tasks
- Execute high-priority quick wins
- Update task statuses and priorities
- Re-plan remaining work
- **Tool Selection Review**: Assess recent tool choices for MCP opportunities

### End of Session (Wrap-up)
- Complete remaining high-priority tasks
- Document progress and blockers
- Plan next session's priorities
- Archive completed work
- **Systematic Tool Review**: Comprehensive analysis of missed MCP opportunities

## Tool Selection Integration

### **Pre-Task Tool Selection Protocol** (REP+PADA Enhanced)

**Before Starting Any Task**:
1. **Domain Classification**: Identify task domain (filesystem/web/github/browser/time)
2. **MCP Capability Check**: Reference MCP Capability Inventory (@infrastructure/modules/operations/mental-toolkit/mcp-capability-inventory.md)
3. **REP+PADA Integration Assessment** ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–:
   - **Complex Analysis**: Consider REP reasoning validation and bias detection
   - **Routine Tasks**: Evaluate PADA autonomous handling opportunities
   - **High Stakes**: Plan REP validation of PADA autonomous actions
   - **Compound Usage**: Identify maximum value integration scenarios
4. **Enhancement Analysis**: What specialized features would MCP/REP/PADA provide?
5. **Selection Decision**: Default to best combination (MCP + REP + PADA where beneficial)
6. **Content Planning**: What files/content will be generated? Plan placement using Content Placement Framework (@infrastructure/modules/operations/mental-toolkit/content-placement-framework.md)

### **During Task Execution** (REP+PADA Enhanced)

**Tool and Content Monitoring**:
- Notice when defaulting to generic tools
- Consider if specialized MCP capabilities would enhance the task
- **REP Integration**: Apply reasoning validation at critical decision points
- **PADA Integration**: Leverage autonomous assistance for routine elements
- Switch to optimal tool combinations when valuable enhancements discovered
- Apply Content Placement framework before creating any files
- Validate placement decisions support intended usage patterns

### **Post-Task Tool Review Protocol** (REP+PADA Enhanced)

**After Task Completion** (Systematic Learning):
1. **MCP Opportunity Assessment**: Could a specialized MCP server have done this better?
2. **REP+PADA Value Analysis** ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–: 
   - Could REP reasoning validation have improved decision quality?
   - Could PADA autonomous assistance have increased efficiency?
   - Was compound REP+PADA usage opportunity missed?
3. **Feature Gap Analysis**: What MCP/REP/PADA features would have added value?
4. **Content Placement Review**: Were all files placed optimally for future discovery and use?
5. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Do all content links and references work correctly?
6. **Pattern Recognition**: What tool selection and placement patterns worked well/poorly?
7. **Compound Value Assessment**: How can REP+PADA integration improve next time?
6. **Mental Model Update**: How can tool selection and content placement improve next time?

### **Tool Selection Quality Gates**

**Session-Level Reviews**:
- **Session Break Review**: Quick assessment of recent tool choices and content placements
- **End of Session Review**: Comprehensive analysis of all tool selections and content organization
- **Pattern Learning**: What systematic improvements can be made to both tool selection and content placement?

**Documentation**:
- Log significant MCP opportunities missed
- Record successful MCP tool usage patterns
- Document effective content placement decisions and problematic patterns
- Update tool selection and content placement mental models based on outcomes
