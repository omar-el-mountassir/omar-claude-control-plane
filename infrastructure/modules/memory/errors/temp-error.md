### **CRITICAL ERROR LOGGED 2025-08-11**: Value Scope Limitation in Prevention Protocols

- **Root Cause**: Created "User Value Preservation" protocols but limited scope to only user-configured functionality, missing broader system value categories
- **Impact**: Prevention protocols inadequate to protect against elimination of system capabilities, architectural value, operational value, or knowledge value during technical changes
- **Correction**: Expand to comprehensive "Value Preservation Protocol" covering ALL system value dimensions: user functionality, system capabilities, architectural value, operational value, knowledge value
- **Prevention**: When creating prevention protocols, always consider full scope of system value that could be impacted, not just the specific category that triggered the error
- **Verification**: Updated autonomous action protocols and system insights to use comprehensive "Value Preservation" rather than narrow "User Value Preservation"
