## Continuity Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Any Claude Code session should be able to continue productive work with zero ambiguity about what to do next.

**Continuity Problems Solved**:

- "What was I working on?" â†’ Clear current work state
- "Where do I start?" â†’ Specific next actions with success criteria
- "What's the context?" â†’ Complete context recovery protocols
- "How do I validate progress?" â†’ Clear success metrics and quality gates

## Work State Management System

### Global Work State (`global/CURRENT-WORK.md`)

- **Purpose**: Always-current work state and priorities
- **Update Protocol**: Updated whenever work priorities change significantly
- **Content**: Current tasks, success criteria, context, progress tracking
- **Access**: Referenced directly from CLAUDE.md as first-class component

### Session Documentation (`sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/`)

- **Purpose**: Complete session-specific context and achievements
- **Template**: `global/templates/documentation/session-documentation-template.md`
- **Integration**: Links to and from current work state
- **Retention**: Permanent retention for architectural intelligence

### Task State Management (TodoWrite Integration)

- **Purpose**: Active task tracking within sessions
- **Integration**: TodoWrite tool for immediate task management
- **Persistence**: Task state reflected in current work documentation
- **Quality Gates**: Task completion validation and documentation

## Session Continuity Protocols

### Session Startup Protocol

1. **Read Current Work**: Start with `global/CURRENT-WORK.md`
2. **Context Validation**: Verify architecture state and integrity
3. **Task Prioritization**: Confirm current priorities are still valid
4. **Quality Gate Check**: Ensure system is ready for productive work

### Session Handoff Protocol

1. **Update Current Work**: Reflect any priority or task changes
2. **Document Progress**: Use session documentation template if significant work completed
3. **Quality Validation**: Ensure all changes pass established quality gates
4. **Evolution Documentation**: Update CHANGELOG.md for major architectural changes

## Session Startup Protocols

### **Standard Session Startup Guide** (Universal - 30 seconds)

**For ALL Claude Code sessions:**

1. âœ… **Load Configuration** - All Tier 1 modules loaded automatically via CLAUDE.md
2. **Power Systems Awareness** - Acknowledge REP+PADA capabilities available ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–
   - **REP**: AI reasoning enhancement with cryptographic validation ready
   - **PADA**: Autonomous assistance with systematic quality assurance ready
   - **Compound Usage**: REP validates PADA actions for maximum reliability
3. **Check Session Optimization** - Set energy level and session type if session-sensitive work
4. **System Health Verification** - Run health check for system integrity  

   ```bash
   uv run global/scripts/core/health-check.py --quiet
   ```

5. **Identify Current Priority** - Check CURRENT-WORK.md for immediate next action
6. **REP+PADA Integration Check** - Consider compound usage opportunities for current tasks
7. **Begin Task Execution** - Use TodoWrite to track progress on priority work

### **Context Recovery Protocols** (If confused about current state)

**Primary Recovery Sources**:
