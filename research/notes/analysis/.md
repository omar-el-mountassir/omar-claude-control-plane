In every industry — whether it’s manufacturing, software development, healthcare, or project management — problems are inevitable. Some are minor hiccups, while others can disrupt entire workflows, delay deliverables, or cause significant financial losses. The difference between organizations that keep thriving and those that struggle often comes down to how effectively they identify and eliminate the true source of a problem — not just its symptoms. That’s where Root Cause Analysis (RCA) comes in.

This guide will walk you step-by-step through running a simple, yet effective RCA, even if you’ve never done one before.

✔️ What Is Root Cause Analysis?
Root Cause Analysis is a structured problem-solving approach used to identify the underlying reason for a problem. The goal isn’t to place blame — it’s to uncover why something went wrong so you can prevent it from happening again.

Key characteristics of RCA:

Focuses on cause, not symptom: It looks beyond surface-level issues.
Prevention over correction: Solutions aim to stop recurrence.
Structured process: Uses proven methods like the 5 Whys or Fishbone Diagram.

✔️ When Should You Run a Root Cause Analysis?
You don’t need to perform an RCA for every small glitch. However, it becomes essential when:

The problem has significant financial or safety impact.
The same issue keeps recurring despite quick fixes.
A project misses critical deadlines or KPIs.
Customer complaints point to a systemic problem.

Example: If a project deliverable is late once due to sick leave, a quick adjustment might suffice. But if delays happen repeatedly, it’s time for an RCA.

✔️ Step-by-Step Guide to Running a Simple Root Cause Analysis
➡️ Step 1: Clearly Define the Problem
A vague problem statement leads to vague solutions. Your problem definition should be specific, measurable, and observable.

Bad example: "The system is slow." Good example: "Page load time increased from 2 seconds to 10 seconds during peak hours, affecting 75% of users over the past week."

📌 Tip: Include where, when, and how often the problem occurs.

➡️ Step 2: Gather Data and Evidence
You can’t solve what you don’t understand. Collect data from logs, user reports, team observations, or system metrics.

Ask yourself:

When did the problem first appear?
What changed before it occurred?
Who or what is affected?

Example: In a manufacturing plant, you might collect production logs, quality control reports, and maintenance records.

Leadership isn’t just a title—it’s a skill. Whether you’re leading a team, managing projects, or preparing for an executive role, continuous learning is key to success.
There are thousands of leadership courses available online, but after reviewing many, I’ve found these 6 to be the best:

✅ Completely free to enroll
🏆 Accredited by world-class institutions
📈 Flexible for busy professionals

If you’re serious about becoming a world-class leader, start with these:

🔹 Clarifying Priorities & Visualizing Your Potential
🎓 Yale University – Enroll Free

🔹 Self-Awareness & Emotional Intelligence
🎓 Indiana University – Enroll Free

➡️ Step 3: Identify Possible Causes
At this stage, don’t jump to conclusions. Brainstorm all potential causes without judgment. You can use tools like:

Brainstorming sessions with cross-functional teams.
Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa) to categorize causes into areas like People, Process, Equipment, Materials, Environment, Management.
Checklists based on previous similar issues.

➡️ Step 4: Use the “5 Whys” Technique
The 5 Whys is one of the simplest and most effective RCA methods. You ask “Why?” repeatedly (often five times) until you uncover the root cause.

Example: Problem: The client did not receive the monthly report.

Why? → The report was not sent.
Why? → The automated system failed to generate it.
Why? → The script stopped running due to a database error.
Why? → The database ran out of storage.
Why? → Storage monitoring alerts were not enabled.

Root Cause: No monitoring system to prevent database overcapacity.

➡️ Step 5: Verify the Root Cause
Before implementing a solution, confirm that the identified cause is indeed the root, not a side effect. You can test this by:

Temporarily fixing the suspected cause and checking if the problem stops.
Reviewing historical data to see if the cause aligns with the problem’s timeline.

➡️ Step 6: Develop and Implement Solutions
Your solution should:

Address the root cause, not just symptoms.
Be practical in terms of time, cost, and resources.
Include preventive measures to avoid recurrence.

Example: If the cause was “no monitoring system,” the solution might be to:

Set up automated storage monitoring.
Create alert thresholds.
Document maintenance protocols.

➡️ Step 7: Monitor Results and Adjust if Needed
After implementing the fix:

Track performance over time.
Gather feedback from stakeholders.
Make adjustments if the problem reappears or shifts.

✔️ Common Mistakes in Simple RCAs
Avoid these pitfalls:

Stopping too early: Settling for the first “why” without digging deeper.
Focusing on people instead of systems: Blaming an individual often ignores systemic weaknesses.
Ignoring data: Relying solely on assumptions can lead you astray.
Not documenting the process: Without records, you risk repeating the same mistakes.

✔️ Tools That Can Help You Run a Simple RCA
While RCA can be done on paper or a whiteboard, software tools make it easier to document and collaborate:

Miro or Lucidchart → Visual Fishbone Diagrams.
Excel/Google Sheets → RCA templates.
Project management software → Link RCA findings to corrective actions.

✔️ Final Thoughts
Running a Root Cause Analysis doesn’t have to be complicated. By defining the problem clearly, asking the right questions, and using simple techniques like the 5 Whys, you can identify the real reason behind recurring issues — and prevent them from coming back.

When done right, RCA turns problems into opportunities for process improvement, cost savings, and stronger team performance.
