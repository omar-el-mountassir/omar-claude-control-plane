## Knowledge vs Memory Distinction

### Knowledge (This Module)

- **Purpose**: Curated information Omar teaches Claude to reference
- **Source**: External materials, research, best practices, documentation
- **Nature**: Static, reference-based, deliberately collected
- **Examples**: Technical documentation, architectural patterns, domain expertise

### Memory (Other Module)  

- **Purpose**: Experiential learning Claude gains through sessions
- **Source**: Session interactions, error patterns, discovered insights
- **Nature**: Dynamic, experience-based, organically learned
- **Examples**: What worked/failed, learned patterns, session histories

## Knowledge Organization Principles

### Domain-Based Structure

- **Technical Domains**: AI/ML, software architecture, specific technologies
- **Methodological Knowledge**: Best practices, design patterns, frameworks
- **Reference Materials**: Documentation, standards, specifications
- **Research Insights**: Papers, articles, analytical findings
- **System Insights**: Accumulated learning about Claude Code system improvements and meta-cognitive discoveries
- **Strategic Insights**: High-level analysis and validation for system architecture and development approaches

### Curation Standards

- **Quality Gate**: Only include knowledge that passes validation
- **Source Attribution**: Always document knowledge origin and date
- **Update Protocol**: Regular review and refresh of knowledge content
- **Relevance Check**: Ensure knowledge aligns with current workflow needs

## Knowledge Management Protocols

### Adding New Knowledge

1. **Source Validation**: Verify credibility and accuracy of source
2. **Relevance Assessment**: Confirm knowledge serves current/future needs
3. **Organization**: Place in appropriate domain-specific subdirectory
4. **Documentation**: Include context, source, and application notes
5. **Integration**: Cross-reference with related config/operations/memory modules

### Knowledge Maintenance

- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly assessment of knowledge relevance
- **Deprecation Protocol**: Remove outdated or superseded knowledge
- **Update Tracking**: Version control for knowledge evolution
- **Usage Analytics**: Monitor which knowledge gets referenced most

## Knowledge Access Patterns

### For AI Agents

- **Reference Queries**: "What does the knowledge base say about [topic]?"
- **Pattern Matching**: Apply curated patterns to current problems
- **Best Practice Lookup**: Find established approaches for challenges
- **Domain Expertise**: Access specialized knowledge for technical domains

### Integration with Other Modules

- **Config Integration**: Knowledge informs configuration decisions
- **Operations Enhancement**: Knowledge improves operational patterns
- **Memory Validation**: Knowledge validates experiential learnings
- **Error Prevention**: Knowledge helps avoid known pitfalls

---

## Initial Knowledge Domains
