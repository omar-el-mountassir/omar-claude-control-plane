# Critical Errors Archive - Session 2025-08-10

## **CRITICAL ERROR LOGGED 2025-08-10**: Workspace Analysis Scope Violation
- **Root Cause**: Analyzed Claude Code workspace (`projects/omar-el-mountassir/repo`) as if it were a standalone project repository
- **Impact**: Created inappropriate technical analysis report with implementation recommendations for personal workspace content
- **Correction**: Distinguish between Claude Code workspaces vs actual project repositories - workspaces contain drafts/specifications, not deployable code
- **Prevention**: Before any technical analysis, determine if path is within `.claude/projects/` (workspace) or external project directory
- **Verification**: Workspace content should be analyzed as methodology/specification development, not as production code requiring technical improvements

## Scope Definition Created
Created `CLAUDE_CODE_SCOPE_DEFINITION.md` establishing clear boundaries:
- **Global Scope**: `C:\Users\omarm\.claude\` - Universal principles across ALL projects
- **Project Scope**: `[PROJECT]/.claude/` - Project-specific configurations  
- **Workspace Scope**: `.claude/projects/` - Development workspaces and specifications
