Create structured documentation project\n3. Clone/recreate analysis environment locally\n4. Document architecture completely with examples\n5. Create reusable templates\n6. Verify documentation completeness before continuing\n\n#### When Implementation Precedes Documentation\n\n1. Research official documentation sources\n2. Create minimal working implementation\n3. Test in isolation\n4. Validate against official schemas\n5. Only then document the working solution\n\n#### When Dependencies Are Missing\n\n1. Check package.json/requirements.txt first\n2. Verify installation status\n3. Test imports in isolation\n4. Add missing dependencies before proceeding\n5. Document dependency requirements\n\n---\n\n## Language Standards\n\n**Primary Language**: English for technical documentation and error logging  \n**Secondary Language**: French for personal notes and non-technical context  \n**Consistency Rule**: Never mix languages within the same technical section\n\n---\n\n## Documentation Standards\n\n### Documentation Requirements\n\n- **Analysis Documentation**: ALWAYS document technical analysis completely and structurally\n- **Decision Logging**: Document architectural decisions with rationale  \n- **Template Creation**: Create reusable templates for reproducible processes\n- **Concrete Deliverables**: Always create tangible output documents for validation and reference\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":70,"oldLines":6,"newStart":70,"newLines":25,"lines":[" Edit(file_path, old_string, new_string)  # ✅ Then edit with exact content"," ```"," ","+### **Automatic Reference Management Protocol (MANDATORY)**","+","+**FOR ANY SYSTEM CHANGE, ADDITION, OR MODIFICATION:**","+","+1. **IMMEDIATE UPDATE REQUIREMENT**: ALL related files and references MUST be updated automatically","+2. **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Never leave references incomplete or outdated","+3. **SYSTEMATIC IDENTIFICATION**: Before any change, identify ALL files that reference the modified content","+4. **BATCH UPDATES**: Update all references in the same session as the primary change","+5. **CROSS-MODULE INTEGRATION**: Ensure changes propagate through config/operations/memory/knowledge/meta modules","+","+#### Reference Update Checklist","+","+- [ ] **CLAUDE.md**: Updated if new modules, categories, or major features added","+- [ ] **Related config modules**: Updated if protocols or standards change","+- [ ] **Integration protocols**: Updated if workflow or process changes","+- [ ] **CURRENT-WORK.md**: Updated if priorities or structure changes","+- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md**: Updated for all architectural changes","+- [ ] **Cross-references**: All `@path/to/file.md` references validated and updated","+"," ### **Workspace vs Project Repository Protocol**"," "," **BEFORE ANY TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:**"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

zero-tolerance audit of the entire repository, leaving no byte unturned, with the objective of guaranteeing a coherent, production-grade, fully committed state.\n\n---\n\n## Autonomous Agent Swarm Architecture\n\n### Agent Specialization Matrix\n\n| **Agent Type** | **Primary Mission** | **Secondary Objectives** | **Deliverables** |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| **Enumeration Agent** | Complete artifact inventory | Version control hygiene validation | File/directory manifest with metadata |\n| **Topology Agent** | System architecture mapping | Interface contract discovery | Dependency graph + architectural model |\n| **Reconnaissance Agent** | Evidence gathering

Domains\n- **Source Code**: All implementation files, modules, packages\n- **Documentation**: README files, API docs, architectural diagrams, specifications\n- **Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, test fixtures\n- **Infrastructure**: Configuration files, deployment manifests, container definitions\n- **Pipelines**: CI/CD configurations, build scripts, automation workflows\n- **Containers**: Docker files, container configurations, orchestration definitions\n- **Diagrams**: System diagrams, architectural models, workflow visualizations\n- **Telemetry**: Monitoring configs, logging configurations, metrics definitions\n\n#### Version Control Hygiene Validation\n- **Uncommitted Changes**: Identify all modifications since last stable baseline\n- **Incomplete Deltas**: Flag partial implementations or work-in-progress\n- **Inconsistent State**: Detect contradictions between declared and actual state\n- **Missing Baselines**: Identify areas lacking proper version control tracking\n\n#### Deliverables\n- Complete manifest of all repository artifacts\n- Version control hygiene report with flagged anomalies\n- Delta analysis since last

systematic process to prevent ANY functionality, capability, or system value loss during technical changes\n\n**Evidence**: Functionality removal error when encountering schema validation - immediately removed properties instead of researching proper implementation alternatives\n\n**Root Cause (5 Whys Analysis)**: Missing meta-cognitive architecture for \"Value Preservation Above Technical Constraints\" - no automatic process that triggers when technical changes might impact ANY system capabilities\n\n**Expanded Scope**: This applies to ALL system value, not just user-configured:\n- User-configured functionality (settings, preferences, customizations)\n- System capabilities (performance, integration, automation)  \n- Architectural value (modularity, extensibility, maintainability)\n- Operational value (monitoring, logging, backup, recovery)\n- Knowledge value (documentation, insights, learnings)\n\n**Critical Prevention Protocol**: \n1. **STOP** - Never immediately remove ANY functionality, capability, or system value\n2. **RESEARCH** - Investigate proper implementation alternatives first  \n3. **PRESERVE** - Technical changes MUST maintain equivalent system value\n4. **ENHANCE** - Look for improvement opportunities during migration\n5. **VALIDATE** - Ensure value equivalence after changes\n\n**Architectural Need**: Value Preservation Engine that automatically detects ANY value changes and triggers preservation protocols\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE** \n\n### **Immediate Application Checklist**\n\n**Before Any Error Analysis**:\n- [ ] Apply 5 Whys methodology automatically (not just surface-level)\n- [ ] Log error IMMEDIATELY before fixing (errors.md)\n- [ ] Check for pattern recognition opportunities\n\n**Before Any File Path References**:\n- [ ] Ask \"Where am I?\" (meta-cognitive protocol)\n- [ ] Calculate paths from current file perspective\n- [ ] Verify relative vs absolute path requirements\n\n**Before Any Technical Changes**:\n- [ ] Value Preservation Engine check - what functionality might be impacted?\n- [ ] Research proper implementation alternatives BEFORE removing anything\n- [ ] Ensure equivalent system value maintained through changes\n\n**For Complex Analysis/Deliverables**:\n- [ ] Document analytical methodology alongside creation\n- [ ] Capture strategic insights discovered during process  \n- [ ] Record decision rationale and alternatives considered\n- [ ] Plan integration with existing architecture\n- [ ] Ensure knowledge preservation for future instances\n\n### **Success Pattern Application**\n\n**Multi-Agent Projects**: Always leverage complete ecosystem (100+ specialists + professional frameworks + community optimization) rather than individual tools\n\n**System Architecture**: Apply systematic component integration with validation through real use for exponential value multiplication\n\n---\n\n## 🔄 **INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n### **For Claude Code Instances**\n1. **Load Quick Reference** section first for immediate protocol activation\n2. **Apply prevention protocols** automatically when patterns emerge  \n3. **Reference specific discoveries** for architectural decisions\n4. **Continue systematic capture** using established format\n\n### **Update Protocol**\n- **Immediate**: Add insights when discovered (don't wait)\n- **Structured**: Use consistent format for discoverability\n- **Evidence-Based**: Include proof and integration instructions  \n- **Cross-Referenced**: Link with relevant config modules\n\n### **Quality Gates**\n- All insights must be actionable (not just observations)\n- Include specific prevention protocols or application methods\n- Provide evidence from actual system usage/failures\n- Cross-reference with errors.md for error-specific learnings\n","numLines":231,"startLine":1,"totalLines":231}}}
