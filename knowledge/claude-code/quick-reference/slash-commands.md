## 🛠️ **ESSENTIAL PATTERNS**

### **1. Confidence Assessment Command**

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Bash(echo:*)
description: Check AI confidence levels before autonomous actions
---

# AI Confidence Assessment

Evaluate my confidence across critical domains:

**Task Understanding**: Rate my understanding 0-100%
**Technical Implementation**: Rate implementation confidence 0-100%  
**Risk Assessment**: Rate risk evaluation confidence 0-100%
**Historical Pattern Match**: Rate similarity to past successes 0-100%

Display results as confidence dashboard:

```

🛡️ CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟢 Task Understanding:    [XX]%
🟢 Implementation:        [XX]%
🟢 Risk Assessment:       [XX]%
🟢 Pattern Match:         [XX]%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

```

**Recommendation**: ✅ PROCEED AUTONOMOUSLY or 🤔 REQUEST CONSULTATION
```

### **2. Safety Gate Command**

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git status:*), Read
description: Validate system health before autonomous actions
---
# System Safety Validation

Check all safety criteria before autonomous action:

1. **Recent Backup**: Verify backup exists within last hour
2. **Architecture Health**: Run health check script
3. **Error History**: Check for critical errors in recent actions
4. **Quality Gates**: Verify all previous operations passed validation

Report status:

```

🛡️ SAFETY GATE STATUS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Recent Backup:        PASS
✅ Architecture Health:  PASS  
✅ Error History:        CLEAN
✅ Quality Gates:        PASS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🟢 SAFE TO PROCEED

```
```

### **3. Pattern Match Command**

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read
description: Analyze current task against historical success patterns
---
# Historical Pattern Analysis

Analyze current task context against our success patterns:

@global/memory/dynamic/relationship/success-patterns.md

Calculate similarity scores:
- **Task Type Match**: How similar to past successful tasks?
- **Context Alignment**: Does current context match success conditions?
- **Resource Availability**: Do we have same resources as past successes?
- **Complexity Level**: Is complexity within proven capability range?

Provide pattern match assessment with success probability estimate.
```

## 🎯 **ADVANCED PATTERNS**

### **Parallel Generation Command** (From infinite-agentic-loop)

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Write, Read, Bash
description: Generate multiple variations simultaneously
---
# Parallel Generation System

Usage: /project:infinite [spec-file] [output-dir] [count]

Examples:
- `/project:infinite specs/api.md src 1` - Single generation
- `/project:infinite specs/ui.md components 5` - 5 parallel variations
- `/project:infinite specs/docs.md content infinite` - Wave-based infinite generation

Wave execution strategy:
- 1-5 agents: Simultaneous execution
- 6-20 agents: Batch processing  
- Infinite: Progressive waves with increasing sophistication

$ARGUMENTS handling for flexible execution patterns.
```

### **Meta-Agent Creation Command**

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Write, Read
description: Create specialized sub-agents for specific domains
---
# Specialized Agent Creation

Create domain-specific sub-agents with:

1. **System Prompt**: Specialized knowledge and behavior
2. **Tool Restrictions**: Limited toolset for security
3. **Color Coding**: Visual identification
4. **Model Selection**: Appropriate model for task complexity

Agent templates:
- **Quality Agent**: Code review, standards validation
- **Security Agent**: Vulnerability scanning, dangerous command blocking  
- **Learning Agent**: Pattern recognition, success tracking
- **Context Agent**: Session continuity, priority management

Generate agent configuration with proper frontmatter and system prompts.
```

## 🔧 **FRONTMATTER CONFIGURATION**

### **Tool Permissions**

```yaml
---
allowed-tools: 
  - "Read"                    # File reading access
  - "Write"                   # File writing access  
  - "Bash(git status:*)"      # Specific bash commands with patterns
  - "Bash"                    # Full bash access (use carefully)
  - "Edit"                    # File editing access
  - "MultiEdit"               # Multiple file editing
  - "Grep"                    # Search capabilities
  - "mcp__*"                  # MCP server access
---
```

### **Command Metadata**

```yaml
---
description: "What this command does (shows in help)"
name: "custom-command-name"  
color: "blue"                # Visual identification
model: "sonnet"              # Preferred model for this command
proactive: true              # Auto-suggest when conditions met
---
```

### **Security Patterns**

```yaml
---
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Bash(echo:*)"]  # Minimal permissions
dangerous-patterns: ["rm -rf", "sudo"]    # Block dangerous operations
sandbox: true                             # Run in isolated environment
timeout: 30000                           # 30 second timeout
---
```

## 💡 **IMPLEMENTATION TIPS**

### **Best Practices**

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with read-only commands, add permissions gradually
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Use `echo` commands to verify logic before real operations
3. **Error Handling**: Include validation and fallback options
4. **Documentation**: Clear descriptions and usage examples in each command
5. **Security First**: Minimal tool permissions, explicit dangerous operation blocking

### **Common Patterns**

- **Validation Commands**: Check system state before operations
- **Automation Commands**: Execute multi-step workflows  
- **Analysis Commands**: Process and summarize information
- **Generation Commands**: Create content or code variations
- **Integration Commands**: Connect with external systems via MCP

### **Debugging Commands**

- Test with `--dry-run` equivalent patterns
- Use `Bash(echo:*)` to output intended actions without execution
- Include verbose logging options for troubleshooting
- Build incremental complexity - start basic, add features

---

## 🔗 **INTEGRATION PATTERNS**

### **With Hook System**

Commands can trigger hooks or be triggered by hooks:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [{"command": "/safety-gate"}]
    }]
  }
}
```

### **With MCP Servers**

Commands can use MCP tools for external integration:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: ["mcp__github-mcp__*"]
---
# GitHub Integration Command
Use GitHub MCP tools to analyze repository, create issues, manage PRs.
```

### **With Sub-Agents**

Commands can delegate to or coordinate with sub-agents:

```markdown
---
description: "Coordinate multiple specialist agents"
---
# Multi-Agent Orchestration
Delegate tasks to quality agent, security agent, and documentation agent.
Monitor coordination and compile results.
```

---

- **Validation Commands**: Pre-action safety and confidence checks
- **Automation Commands**: Multi-step workflow execution
