Meta announced in late 2024 that they are going to be rolling out an option to reset the Instagram algorithm soon.\n\nIn April 2024, Instagram's algorithm focused less on big brands and more on \"chances to break through.\" This adjustment also rewards creators for unique content.\n\n## Top Ranking Factors for 2025\n\n### The Three Most Important Signals:\nFor both connected and unconnected reach, the top three signals that matter most for ranking are watch time, likes, and sends.\n\n### Key Engagement Factors:\n- **Watch Time**: The more time someone spends on your content, the better your ranking\n- **Shares/Sends**: The most potent trigger in Instagram's current algorithm is shares. Mosseri explicitly stated that shares are prioritized even over saves because they align with Instagram's goal of inspiring creativity that brings people together\n- **Comments, Likes, and Saves**: Shares, Saves, and Comments are the top three metrics influencing the algorithm\n\n## Best Practices for Organic Growth\n\n### Content Strategy:\n1. **Focus on Video Content**: Instagram continues to prioritise video content, especially Reels. Invest in short, engaging, and mobile-friendly formats\n\n2. **Optimize Video Length**: Instagram's best practices now recommend reels between 30 to 90 seconds for maximum engagement and reach. Videos exceeding 90 seconds, while valuable for nurturing existing audiences, are less likely to be recommended to new viewers\n\n3. **Master the Hook**: Mosseri stresses the critical nature of the first three seconds of a reel, dubbing it \"the hook.\" This isn't just anecdotal advice; data shows that viewer retention in these initial seconds is remarkably consistent across videos, regardless of their ultimate performance\n\n### Posting Strategy:\n1. **Use Carousels**: Carousels have emerged as a powerhouse for engagement. Instagram's best practices now explicitly state that carousels typically outperform single image posts. The rationale behind this is twofold: firstly, multiple pieces of media in a single post increase the likelihood of interactions, which in turn boosts reach\n\n2. **Consistent Posting**: Instagram's best practices suggest that accounts posting around 10 times per month (roughly 2-3 times a week) see optimal results\n\n3. **Use Stories Regularly**: \"creators who post to Stories often see fewer unfollows than creators who don't, which can lead to stronger growth over time\"\n\n### Engagement Tactics:\n1. **Build Relationships**: The 3 most important ranking factors of the Instagram algorithm are: Relationship between the creator and the viewer... If you have a repeated interaction history with a specific user in the past, you are more likely to see the new content they post. (This is very important for businesses: Active community management, including responding to direct messages and comments, can improve a brand's visibility on Instagram.)\n\n2. **Respond Quickly**: Mosseri emphasizes the importance of timely responses to comments, ideally within a couple of days, to maintain conversation momentum and signal to the algorithm that your content is fostering active discussions\n\n### Technical Considerations:\n1. **Hashtag Strategy**: A surprising revelation from Mosseri is the diminished importance of hashtags. Once a cornerstone of content discovery on the platform, hashtags have been largely supplanted by advanced AI that can understand and categorize content based on the video itself. Hashtags aren't completely dead — people can still find your posts through hashtag searches. Stick to three to five relevant hashtags per post rather than loading up with dozens\n\n2. **Avoid Watermarks**: While the platform actively deprioritizes content with watermarks from other apps, Mosseri clarified that using your own logo is perfectly acceptable\n\n3. **Create Original Content**: Instagram prioritises high-quality, original content over reposts or low-effort creations\n\nThe key takeaway is that Consistency, creativity, and meaningful engagement are key to staying visible to both new and existing followers, and the algorithm is designed to reward content that genuinely engages users and keeps them on the platform longer."}]},"uuid":"390dced1-54e7-4001-9f81-8396a4e70f56","timestamp":"2025-08-11T20:18:37.292Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Instagram algorithm 2024 2025 organic growth best practices engagement factors","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01BQkhNpQKqUR4GJUtcjLYko","content":[{"title":"Instagram algorithm tips for 2025: Everything you need to know","url":"https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-algorithm/"},{"title":"How the Instagram Algorithm Works in 2025 | Ultimate Guide","url":"https://later.com/blog/how-instagram-algorithm-works/"},{"title":"Mastering the Instagram Algorithm: Essential Tips for 2025 Success | Brandwatch","url":"https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-algorithm/"},{"title":"The Instagram Algorithm in 2025 (It's Never Too Late to Grow) - Foundr","url":"https://foundr.com/articles/social-media/instagram-algorithm"},{"title":"How the Instagram Algorithm Works: Your 2025 Guide","url":"https://buffer.com/resources/instagram-algorithms/"},{"title":"Instagram Algorithm Explained: Your 2025 Guide - SocialBee","url":"https://socialbee.com/blog/instagram-algorithm/"},{"title":"How does the Instagram algorithm work in 2025?
