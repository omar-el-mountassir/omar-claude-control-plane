## Architecture Transformation Summary

### From: Four-Category Fragmented Structure
```
modules/config/global/
â”œâ”€â”€ Mixed semantic domains
â”œâ”€â”€ Scattered operational data  
â”œâ”€â”€ Inconsistent organization
â””â”€â”€ Limited infrastructure support
```

### To: Five-Category Complete System
```
global/
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/           # Semantic core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/       # Rules and standards
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ operations/   # Behavioral patterns  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ memory/       # Experiential learning
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ knowledge/    # Curated reference materials
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ meta/         # System self-reflection
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/             # Operational observability
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/        # Reusable patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/          # Automation utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ integrations/     # External connections  
â””â”€â”€ cache/            # Performance optimization
