# Conversation Closure Protocol

Conduct a comprehensive, line-by-line audit of the entire conversation, flagging every open task, dangling question, implicit requirement, or ambiguous statement; for each, either resolve it on the spot or produce a concise, actionable follow-up plan. Immediately after, generate a cryptographically signed, version-controlled snapshot that immutably records every completed action, decision, artifact, and its precise storage location, then emit a single, unambiguous “CLOSED” signal only when absolute certainty of completeness and retrievability is achieved.
