## Critical Errors Archive

### **CRITICAL ERROR LOGGED 2025-08-11**: Functionality Removal Instead of Migration

- **Root Cause**: When encountering JSON schema validation errors, immediately removed problematic properties (`additionalDirectories`, `statusLine`) instead of researching proper implementation methods
- **Impact**: Temporarily eliminated valuable functionality (multi-drive access, professional status line) rather than preserving it through correct configuration
- **Correction**: NEVER remove functionality to fix schema issues - always research proper implementation alternatives and migrate functionality to compliant methods
- **Prevention**: When schema validation fails: (1) Research official documentation for proper configuration, (2) Check if functionality exists through alternative paths, (3) Implement proper migration preserving all capabilities, (4) Enhance functionality during migration where possible
- **Verification**: All functionality preserved: multi-drive access confirmed via MCP filesystem server, status line implemented via proper command-based script with enhanced project context

### **CRITICAL ERROR LOGGED 2025-08-11**: Value Scope Limitation in Prevention Protocols

- **Root Cause**: Created "User Value Preservation" protocols but limited scope to only user-configured functionality, missing broader system value categories
- **Impact**: Prevention protocols inadequate to protect against elimination of system capabilities, architectural value, operational value, or knowledge value during technical changes
- **Correction**: Expand to comprehensive "Value Preservation Protocol" covering ALL system value dimensions: user functionality, system capabilities, architectural value, operational value, knowledge value
- **Prevention**: When creating prevention protocols, always consider full scope of system value that could be impacted, not just the specific category that triggered the error
- **Verification**: Updated autonomous action protocols and system insights to use comprehensive "Value Preservation" rather than narrow "User Value Preservation"

## Error Prevention Meta-Protocols

### Adding New Error Entries

**When logging a new critical error:**

1. Follow the established template format exactly
2. Include specific prevention protocol
3. Update relevant config module if protocol changes are needed
4. Cross-reference with related protocols in standards.md
5. Verify prevention protocol is actionable and specific

### Error Review Process

**Monthly Review (Next: 2025-09-11)**:

- Review all logged errors for pattern identification
- Update prevention protocols based on new learnings
- Archive resolved errors that no longer provide value
- Update related protocols in other config modules

### Cross-Module Integration

**Errors that impact other modules:**

- File editing protocols → standards.md
- Documentation requirements → core.md  
- Session protocols → sessions.md
- Quality gates → standards.md
- Value preservation → autonomous-action.md

**Always update the affected module when an error leads to protocol changes.**
