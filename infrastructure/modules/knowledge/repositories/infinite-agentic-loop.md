## Core Architecture - Custom Slash Command

### The Infinite Command Implementation

**File**: `.claude/commands/infinite.md`

This is the complete implementation of the infinite agentic loop command:

```markdown
**INFINITE AGENTIC LOOP COMMAND**

Think deeply about this infinite generation task. You are about to embark on a sophisticated iterative creation process.

**Variables:**

spec_file: $ARGUMENTS
output_dir: $ARGUMENTS
count: $ARGUMENTS

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `spec_file` - Path to the markdown specification file
2. `output_dir` - Directory where iterations will be saved  
3. `count` - Number of iterations (1-N or "infinite")

**PHASE 1: SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS**
Read and deeply understand the specification file at `spec_file`. This file defines:
- What type of content to generate
- The format and structure requirements
- Any specific parameters or constraints
- The intended evolution pattern between iterations

Think carefully about the spec's intent and how each iteration should build upon previous work.

**PHASE 2: OUTPUT DIRECTORY RECONNAISSANCE** 
Thoroughly analyze the `output_dir` to understand the current state:
- List all existing files and their naming patterns
- Identify the highest iteration number currently present
- Analyze the content evolution across existing iterations
- Understand the trajectory of previous generations
- Determine what gaps or opportunities exist for new iterations

**PHASE 3: ITERATION STRATEGY**
Based on the spec analysis and existing iterations:
- Determine the starting iteration number (highest existing + 1)
- Plan how each new iteration will be unique and evolutionary
- Consider how to build upon previous iterations while maintaining novelty
- If count is "infinite", prepare for continuous generation until context limits

**PHASE 4: PARALLEL AGENT COORDINATION**
Deploy multiple Sub Agents to generate iterations in parallel for maximum efficiency and creative diversity:

**Sub-Agent Distribution Strategy:**
- For count 1-5: Launch all agents simultaneously 
- For count 6-20: Launch in batches of 5 agents to manage coordination
- For "infinite": Launch waves of 3-5 agents, monitoring context and spawning new waves

**Agent Assignment Protocol:**
Each Sub Agent receives:
1. **Spec Context**: Complete specification file analysis
2. **Directory Snapshot**: Current state of output_dir at launch time
3. **Iteration Assignment**: Specific iteration number (starting_number + agent_index)
4. **Uniqueness Directive**: Explicit instruction to avoid duplicating concepts from existing iterations
5. **Quality Standards**: Detailed requirements from the specification

**Agent Task Specification:**
```

TASK: Generate iteration [NUMBER] for [SPEC_FILE] in [OUTPUT_DIR]

You are Sub Agent [X] generating iteration [NUMBER].

CONTEXT:

- Specification: [Full spec analysis]
- Existing iterations: [Summary of current output_dir contents]
- Your iteration number: [NUMBER]
- Assigned creative direction: [Specific innovation dimension to explore]

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Read and understand the specification completely
2. Analyze existing iterations to ensure your output is unique
3. Generate content following the spec format exactly
4. Focus on [assigned innovation dimension] while maintaining spec compliance
5. Create file with exact name pattern specified
6. Ensure your iteration adds genuine value and novelty

DELIVERABLE: Single file as specified, with unique innovative content

```

**Parallel Execution Management:**
- Launch all assigned Sub Agents simultaneously using Task tool
- Monitor agent progress and completion
- Handle any agent failures by reassigning iteration numbers
- Ensure no duplicate iteration numbers are generated
- Collect and validate all completed iterations

**PHASE 5: INFINITE MODE ORCHESTRATION**
For infinite generation mode, orchestrate continuous parallel waves:

**Wave-Based Generation:**
1. **Wave Planning**: Determine next wave size (3-5 agents) based on context capacity
2. **Agent Preparation**: Prepare fresh context snapshots for each new wave
3. **Progressive Sophistication**: Each wave should explore more advanced innovation dimensions
4. **Context Monitoring**: Track total context usage across all agents and main orchestrator
5. **Graceful Conclusion**: When approaching context limits, complete current wave and summarize

**Infinite Execution Cycle:**
```

WHILE context_capacity > threshold:
    1. Assess current output_dir state
    2. Plan next wave of agents (size based on remaining context)
    3. Assign increasingly sophisticated creative directions
    4. Launch parallel Sub Agent wave
    5. Monitor wave completion
    6. Update directory state snapshot
    7. Evaluate context capacity remaining
    8. If sufficient capacity: Continue to next wave
    9. If approaching limits: Complete final wave and summarize

```

**Progressive Sophistication Strategy:**
- **Wave 1**: Basic functional replacements with single innovation dimension
- **Wave 2**: Multi-dimensional innovations with enhanced interactions  
- **Wave 3**: Complex paradigm combinations with adaptive behaviors
- **Wave N**: Revolutionary concepts pushing the boundaries of the specification

**Context Optimization:**
- Each wave uses fresh agent instances to avoid context accumulation
- Main orchestrator maintains lightweight state tracking
- Progressive summarization of completed iterations to manage context
- Strategic pruning of less essential details in later waves

**EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:**

**Quality & Uniqueness:**
- Each iteration must be genuinely unique and valuable
- Build upon previous work while introducing novel elements
- Maintain consistency with the original specification
- Ensure proper file organization and naming

**Parallel Coordination:**
- Deploy Sub Agents strategically to maximize creative diversity
- Assign distinct innovation dimensions to each agent to avoid overlap
- Coordinate timing to prevent file naming conflicts
- Monitor all agents for successful completion and quality

**Scalability & Efficiency:**
- Think deeply about the evolution trajectory across parallel streams
- For infinite mode, optimize for maximum valuable output before context exhaustion
- Use wave-based generation to manage context limits intelligently  
- Balance parallel speed with quality and coordination overhead

**Agent Management:**
- Provide each Sub Agent with complete context and clear assignments
- Handle agent failures gracefully with iteration reassignment
- Ensure all parallel outputs integrate cohesively with the overall progression

**ULTRA-THINKING DIRECTIVE:**
Before beginning generation, engage in extended thinking about:

**Specification & Evolution:**
- The deeper implications of the specification
- How to create meaningful progression across iterations  
- What makes each iteration valuable and unique
- How to balance consistency with innovation

**Parallel Strategy:**
- Optimal Sub Agent distribution for the requested count
- How to assign distinct creative directions to maximize diversity
- Wave sizing and timing for infinite mode
- Context management across multiple parallel agents

**Coordination Challenges:**
- How to prevent duplicate concepts across parallel streams
- Strategies for ensuring each agent produces genuinely unique output
- Managing file naming and directory organization with concurrent writes
- Quality control mechanisms for parallel outputs

**Infinite Mode Optimization:**
- Wave-based generation patterns for sustained output
- Progressive sophistication strategies across multiple waves
- Context capacity monitoring and graceful conclusion planning
- Balancing speed of parallel generation with depth of innovation

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Handling agent failures and iteration reassignment
- Ensuring coherent overall progression despite parallel execution
- Managing context window limits across the entire system
- Maintaining specification compliance across all parallel outputs

Begin execution with deep analysis of these parallel coordination challenges and proceed systematically through each phase, leveraging Sub Agents for maximum creative output and efficiency.

## Usage Patterns

### Command Syntax

```
/project:infinite <spec_file> <output_dir> <count>
```

### 4 Command Variants

#### 1. Single Generation

```bash
/project:infinite specs/invent_new_ui_v3.md src 1
```

Generate one new iteration using the UI specification.

#### 2. Small Batch (5 iterations)

```bash
/project:infinite specs/invent_new_ui_v3.md src_new 5
```

Deploy 5 parallel agents to generate 5 unique iterations simultaneously.

#### 3. Large Batch (20 iterations)

```bash
/project:infinite specs/invent_new_ui_v3.md src_new 20
```

Generate 20 iterations in coordinated batches of 5 agents for optimal resource management.

#### 4. Infinite Mode

```bash
/project:infinite specs/invent_new_ui_v3.md infinite_src_new/ infinite
```

Continuous generation in waves until context limits are reached, with progressive sophistication.
