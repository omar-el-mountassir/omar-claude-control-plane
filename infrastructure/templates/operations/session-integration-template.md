# Session Integration Template

**Purpose**: Standardize session workflow with systematic logging integration  
**Usage**: Copy to session directory and adapt for specific session  
**Frequency**: Regular (every significant session)  

---

## Session Planning Phase

### 1. Logging System Review (2-3 minutes)

**Check Accumulated Items**:
- [ ] Review `global/logs/challenges/challenge-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- [ ] Review `global/logs/tasks/task-log-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- [ ] Review `global/logs/templates/template-requests-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Batch Processing Decision**:
- [ ] Items ready for batch processing? (3+ related items)
- [ ] Items blocking current work? (immediate execution needed)
- [ ] Items can wait? (continue with planned work)

### 2. Session Goal Setting

**Primary Objective**: _[What is the main goal of this session?]_

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] _[Specific measurable outcome 1]_
- [ ] _[Specific measurable outcome 2]_
- [ ] _[Quality gate or validation requirement]_

**Integration with Logged Items**:
- [ ] No integration needed - focus on primary objective
- [ ] Partial integration - address related logged items
- [ ] Full batch processing - logged items are the session focus

## During Session Workflow

### Systematic Logging Integration

**When to Log vs Execute Immediately**:

#### Log for Strategic Processing
- [ ] **Complex tasks** (multi-step, requires planning)
- [ ] **Non-blocking work** (other work can continue)  
- [ ] **Research/analysis** (investigation needed)
- [ ] **Organization tasks** (cleanup, restructuring)

#### Execute with TodoWrite
- [ ] **Blocking tasks** (can't proceed without completion)
- [ ] **Quick tasks** (single step, < 5 minutes)
- [ ] **Context-dependent** (needs current conversation state)
- [ ] **Critical tasks** (urgent fix needed)

### Real-Time Decision Framework

**For each new task that emerges**:

1. **Assess**: Blocking, Quick, Context-dependent, or Critical?
2. **Decision**: 
   - YES to any above → Use TodoWrite immediately
   - NO to all → Log strategically for batch processing
3. **Execute**: Follow chosen approach consistently

### Challenge and Template Opportunities

**Challenge Logging Triggers**:
- [ ] Absolute statements ("always/never/obviously")
- [ ] Unsupported claims without evidence
- [ ] Rushed decisions under pressure
- [ ] Dismissing alternatives without evaluation

**Template Request Triggers**:
- [ ] Repeating similar format/structure needs
- [ ] Complex multi-section reusable format needed
- [ ] Pattern that would benefit from optimization
- [ ] Related to existing template families

---

## Session Completion Phase

### 1. Batch Processing Review (5-10 minutes)

**Review Logged Items**:
- [ ] Any high-priority items to process now?
- [ ] Items that became more urgent during session?
- [ ] Natural batch processing opportunities created?

**Processing Decision**:
- [ ] Process now (items are urgent/related to session work)
- [ ] Schedule for next session (items are important but not urgent)
- [ ] Leave for dedicated batch processing session

### 2. Session Integration Actions

**Documentation Update**:
- [ ] Update relevant logged items with session insights
- [ ] Add new logged items discovered during session
- [ ] Update priorities based on session outcomes

**Cross-Reference Integration**:
- [ ] Session outcomes inform logged challenge reviews
- [ ] Session patterns generate template requests
- [ ] Session tasks create follow-up strategic tasks

### 3. Handoff Preparation

**Next Session Setup**:
- [ ] Clear primary objective for next session
- [ ] Logged items status for next review
- [ ] Integration opportunities identified
- [ ] Continuation context documented

## Template Adaptation Instructions

### For Different Session Types

**Technical Implementation Sessions**:
- Focus more on TodoWrite for immediate execution
- Log complex architecture/system improvement tasks
- Higher threshold for challenge logging (technical decisions)

**Strategic Planning Sessions**:
- Higher emphasis on systematic logging
- More template requests (planning formats)
- More challenge logging (assumption testing)

**Batch Processing Sessions**:
- Primary focus on processing logged items
- Minimal new logging during session
- High completion rate target

### Customization Fields

**Session-Specific Additions**:
```markdown
## Session-Specific Workflow
_[Add custom workflow elements for this session type]_

## Domain-Specific Considerations  
_[Add domain expertise requirements or special considerations]_

## Success Metrics
_[Add specific success metrics beyond template defaults]_
```

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Session
- [ ] Logging system review completed
- [ ] Session goals clearly defined
- [ ] Integration strategy decided

### During Session
- [ ] Consistent application of log vs execute decision framework
- [ ] Real-time priority assessment for emerging items
- [ ] Systematic capture of challenges, tasks, templates

### Post-Session
- [ ] Batch processing review completed
- [ ] Documentation updates applied
- [ ] Next session handoff prepared
- [ ] Session integration validated
