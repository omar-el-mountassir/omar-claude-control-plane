## Phase 1: Complete Repository Enumeration

### Enumeration Agent Objectives

**Primary Mission**: Enumerate every file, directory, and artifact across all domains

#### Target Domains
- **Source Code**: All implementation files, modules, packages
- **Documentation**: README files, API docs, architectural diagrams, specifications
- **Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, test fixtures
- **Infrastructure**: Configuration files, deployment manifests, container definitions
- **Pipelines**: CI/CD configurations, build scripts, automation workflows
- **Containers**: Docker files, container configurations, orchestration definitions
- **Diagrams**: System diagrams, architectural models, workflow visualizations
- **Telemetry**: Monitoring configs, logging configurations, metrics definitions

#### Version Control Hygiene Validation
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Identify all modifications since last stable baseline
- **Incomplete Deltas**: Flag partial implementations or work-in-progress
- **Inconsistent State**: Detect contradictions between declared and actual state
- **Missing Baselines**: Identify areas lacking proper version control tracking

#### Deliverables
- Complete manifest of all repository artifacts
- Version control hygiene report with flagged anomalies
- Delta analysis since last stable baseline
- Metadata catalog with file types, sizes, modifications, ownership

## Phase 2: System Topology Mapping

### Topology Agent Objectives

**Primary Mission**: Map the complete system architecture and discover all contracts

#### Architecture Discovery
- **Module Boundaries**: Parse and document all module interfaces and boundaries
- **Interface Contracts**: Catalog all API contracts, service interfaces, data contracts
- **Data Schemas**: Document all data models, database schemas, message formats
- **Dependency Graphs**: Build comprehensive dependency networks (internal + external)
- **Runtime Metrics**: Analyze runtime behavior patterns and performance characteristics
- **Deployment Manifests**: Parse all deployment configurations and infrastructure definitions

#### Anomaly Detection
- **Architecture Drift**: Identify deviations from declared architectural patterns
- **Redundancy Analysis**: Detect duplicate functionality or overlapping responsibilities
- **Contract Violations**: Flag inconsistencies between interface declarations and usage
- **Dependency Contradictions**: Identify conflicting dependency requirements or circular dependencies

#### Deliverables
- Complete system topology map with all components and relationships
- Interface contract catalog with usage validation
- Dependency graph analysis with conflict identification
- Architecture compliance report with drift analysis

## Phase 3: Deep Reconnaissance Missions

### Reconnaissance Agent Objectives

**Primary Mission**: Launch parallel investigations to surface all hidden constraints and assumptions

#### Evidence Gathering Strategies
- **Code Archaeology**: Deep commit history analysis to understand evolution patterns
- **Static Dependency Tracing**: Comprehensive static analysis of all dependency chains
- **Dynamic Runtime Introspection**: Live system analysis of actual runtime behavior
- **Stakeholder Interrogations**: Systematic extraction of tacit knowledge from system artifacts

#### Investigation Targets
- **Hidden Constraints**: Implicit assumptions embedded in code or configuration
- **Undocumented Dependencies**: Usage patterns not reflected in explicit dependency declarations
- **Legacy Behaviors**: Historical patterns that may conflict with current architecture
- **Environmental Assumptions**: System expectations about deployment or runtime environment

#### Parallel Mission Execution
- **Multiple Investigation Threads**: Simultaneous analysis across different system dimensions
- **Cross-Validation**: Verification of findings across multiple evidence sources
- **Anomaly Triangulation**: Confirmation of issues through independent discovery methods
- **Evidence Chain Validation**: Verification of causal relationships and dependencies

#### Deliverables
- Comprehensive investigation reports for each analyzed dimension
- Cross-validated evidence chains for all discovered issues
- Hidden constraint and assumption catalog
- System evolution analysis with historical context

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Remediation Planning

### Synthesis Agent Objectives

**Primary Mission**: Consolidate all findings into a single, ruthlessly prioritized remediation dossier

#### Findings Integration
- **Multi-Agent Data Fusion**: Combine discoveries from all specialized agents
- **Anomaly Cross-Reference**: Validate issues discovered by multiple agents
- **Impact Assessment**: Analyze potential consequences of each identified issue
- **Priority Matrix**: Rank issues by severity, impact, and remediation complexity

#### Remediation Specification
- **Exact Refactor Tasks**: Precise specifications for required code changes
- **Creation Tasks**: Detailed requirements for missing components or documentation
- **Documentation Tasks**: Specific documentation gaps that must be addressed
- **Validation Criteria**: Measurable acceptance criteria for each remediation task

#### Accountability Assignment
- **Single Owner per Task**: Clear accountability assignment for each remediation item
- **Skill-Task Matching**: Assignment based on required expertise and system knowledge
- **Dependency Scheduling**: Task ordering based on prerequisite relationships
- **Progress Tracking**: Mechanisms for monitoring remediation progress

#### Quality Assurance
- **Completion Verification**: Objective criteria for confirming task completion
- **Integration Testing**: Validation that remediation doesn't introduce new issues
- **Production Readiness**: Final verification of production-grade system state
- **Baseline Establishment**: Creation of new stable baseline after remediation

#### Deliverables
- **Master Remediation Dossier**: Single authoritative document containing all findings and remediation plans
- **Priority-Ordered Task List**: Complete task catalog with dependencies and assignments
- **Acceptance Criteria Catalog**: Measurable completion criteria for all tasks
- **Production Readiness Certification Plan**: Framework for final system validation

## Current Status

**BLOCKED**: This task requires Claude Code orchestration capabilities that are not currently available.

**Prerequisites for Execution**:
- Multi-agent coordination and deployment system
