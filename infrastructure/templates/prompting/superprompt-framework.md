- What assumptions need validation?

Step 2: Solution Architecture
- What approaches are available?
- What are the trade-offs?
- What factors influence success?

Step 3: Implementation Strategy
- What are the concrete next steps?
- What resources are required?
- What risks need mitigation?

Step 4: Success Validation  
- How will success be measured?
- What feedback loops exist?
- How will we iterate and improve?
</thinking>
```

### **RACE Framework Integration**
