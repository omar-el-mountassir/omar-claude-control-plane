## üìö **Comprehensive Capability Analysis**

### **1. Slash Commands System**

#### **Built-in Commands Available**

- **Core Management**: `/clear`, `/help`, `/config`, `/model`, `/login`, `/logout`
- **Development Workflow**: `/review`, `/init`, `/agents`, `/memory`
- **Advanced Features**: MCP slash commands, dynamic command discovery

#### **Custom Command Architecture**

```
Command Locations:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/.claude/commands/          # Personal commands (all projects)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/commands/           # Project-specific commands (team shared)

Command Features:
- Frontmatter configuration with tools/permissions
- Argument handling via $ARGUMENTS
- Bash command execution with ! prefix
- File referencing with @ syntax
- Namespacing through directory structures
```

#### **Example Custom Command Structure**

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git status:*)
description: Create a git commit with analysis
---
Based on current changes, analyze the diff and create a single semantic commit.

!git diff --staged
Analyze the changes and create appropriate commit message.
```

#### **Agentic Applications**

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Custom commands can orchestrate multi-step processes
- **Quality Gate Automation**: Commands can enforce standards and validation
- **Context-Aware Actions**: Commands can access project state and user preferences
- **Intelligent Task Delegation**: Commands can invoke sub-agents for specialized work

### **2. Hook System Architecture**

#### **Hook Types and Events**

- **PreToolUse**: Execute before Claude uses any tool (validation, preparation)
- **PostToolUse**: Execute after tool completion (logging, follow-up actions)
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Execute when user submits prompts (context injection)

#### **Hook Configuration Example**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/quality-gate-check.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": ".*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command", 
            "command": "/path/to/learning-capture.sh"
          }
        ]

### **4. Memory Management System**

#### **Memory Hierarchy (Precedence Order)**

1. **Enterprise Policy** (system-wide, highest precedence)
2. **Project Memory** (`project/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
3. **User Memory** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
4. **Project-Specific Memory** (deprecated)

#### **Dynamic Memory Features**

```
Memory Capabilities:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Automatic Discovery      # Recursively loads CLAUDE.md files up directory tree
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Import System           # @path/to/import syntax with 5-hop depth limit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Quick Addition          # # shortcut for immediate memory updates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Live Editing           # /memory command for direct memory file modification
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Hierarchical Override   # Higher-level memories take precedence
```
